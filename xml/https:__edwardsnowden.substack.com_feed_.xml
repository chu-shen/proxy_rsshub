Also, the napkin will still work when the power-grid fails<strong>. </strong></p><p>The perfect companion for any reader&#8217;s lunch.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 " target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bfcc216-3b42-455b-b071-6244bbe39ea7_300x250.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bfcc216-3b42-455b-b071-6244bbe39ea7_300x250.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6bfcc216-3b42-455b-b071-6244bbe39ea7_300x250.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21702,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>3.</p><p>Advocates of CBDCs contend that these strictly-centralized currencies are the realization of a bold new standard&#8212;not a Gold Standard, or a Silver Standard, or even a Blockchain Standard, but something like a Spreadsheet Standard, where every central-bank-issued-dollar is held by a central-bank-managed account, recorded in a vast ledger-of-State that can be continuously scrutizined and eternally revised.</p><p>CBDC proponents claim that this will make everyday transactions both safer (by removing counterparty risk), and easier to tax (by rendering it well nigh impossible to hide money from the government).&nbsp;</p><p>CBDC opponents, however, cite that very same purported &#8220;safety&#8221; and &#8220;ease&#8221; to argue that an e-dollar, say, is merely an extension to, or financial manifestation of, the ever-encroaching surveillance state. To these critics, the method<em> </em>by which this proposal eradicates bankruptcy fallout and tax dodgers draws a bright red line under its deadly flaw: these only come at the cost of placing the State, newly privy to the use and custodianship of every dollar, at the center of monetary interaction. Look at China, the napkin-clingers cry, where the new ban on Bitcoin, along with the release of the digital-yuan, is clearly intended to increase the ability of the State to &#8220;intermediate&#8221;&#8212;to impose itself in the middle of&#8212;every last transaction.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-180-184" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F777d2688-2a9e-4a7f-974f-6593653d7d6a_184x180.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F777d2688-2a9e-4a7f-974f-6593653d7d6a_184x180.png" width="184" height="180" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/777d2688-2a9e-4a7f-974f-6593653d7d6a_184x180.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:180,&quot;width&quot;:184,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:31105,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

Today you can enjoy any of these in three clicks.</p><p>Still, banks have an older role. Since the inception of commercial banking, or at least since its capitalization by central banking, the industry&#8217;s most important function has been the <em>moving</em> of money, fulfilling the promise of those promissory notes of old by allowing their redemption in different cities, or in different countries, and by allowing bearers and redeemers of those notes to make payments on their and others&#8217; behalf across similar distances. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-402-620" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9a9fa19-c53b-4385-898e-5e3b1e659e5c_620x402.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9a9fa19-c53b-4385-898e-5e3b1e659e5c_620x402.jpeg" width="620" height="402" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9a9fa19-c53b-4385-898e-5e3b1e659e5c_620x402.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:402,&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77827,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

But as intrinsically valuable money gave way to our little napkins, and napkins give way to their intangible digital equivalents, that has changed.</p><p>Today, however, there isn&#8217;t much in the vaults. If you walk into a bank, even without a mask over your face, and attempt a sizable withdrawal, you&#8217;re almost always going to be told to come back next Wednesday, as the physical currency you&#8217;re requesting has to be ordered from the rare branch or reserve that actually has it. Meanwhile, the guard, no less mythologized in the mind than the granite and marble he paces, is just an old man with tired feet, paid too little to use the gun that he carries.&nbsp;</p><p>These are what commercial banks have been reduced to: &#8220;intermediating&#8221; money-ordering-services<strong> </strong>that profit off penalties and fees&#8212;protected by your grandfather.</p><p>In sum, in an increasingly digital society, there is almost nothing a bank can do to provide access to and protect your assets that an algorithm can&#8217;t replicate and improve upon.</p><p>On the other hand, when Christmas comes around, cryptocurrencies don&#8217;t give out those little tiny desk calendars.</p><p>But let&#8217;s return to close with that bank security guard, who after helping to close up the bank for the day probably goes off to work a second job, to make ends meet&#8212;at a gas station, say.&nbsp;</p><p>Will a CBDC be helpful to him? Will an e-dollar improve his life, more than a cash dollar would, or a dollar-equivalent in Bitcoin, or <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work905.pdf">in some stablecoin</a>, or even in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/06/us-fdic-said-to-be-studying-deposit-insurance-for-stablecoins/">an FDIC-insured stablecoin</a>?</p><p>Let&#8217;s say that his doctor has told him that the sedentary or just-standing-around nature of his work at the bank has impacted his health, and contributed to dangerous weight gain. Our guard must cut down on sugar, and his private insurance company&#8212;which he&#8217;s been publicly mandated to deal with&#8212;now starts tracking his pre-diabetic condition and passes data on that condition on to the systems that control his CBDC wallet, so that the next time he goes to the deli and tries to buy some candy, he&#8217;s rejected&#8212;he can&#8217;t&#8212;his wallet just refuses to pay, even if it was his intention to buy that candy for his granddaughter.</p><p>Or, let&#8217;s say that one of his e-dollars, which he received as a tip at his gas station job, happens to be later registered by a central authority as having been used, by its previous possessor, to execute a suspicious transaction, whether it was a drug deal or a donation to a totally innocent and in fact totally life-affirming charity operating in a foreign country deemed hostile to US foreign policy, and so it becomes frozen and even has to be &#8220;civilly&#8221; forfeited. How will our beleagured guard get it back? Will he ever be able to prove that said e-dollar is legitimately his and retake possession of it, and how much would that proof ultimately cost him?</p><p>Our guard earns his living with his labor&#8212;he earns it with his body, and yet by the time that body inevitably breaks down, will he have amassed enough of a grubstake to comfortably retire? And if not, can he ever hope to rely on the State&#8217;s benevolent, or even adequate, provision&#8212;for his welfare, his care, his healing?&nbsp;</p><p>This is the question that I&#8217;d like Waller, that I&#8217;d like all of the Fed, and the Treasury, and the rest of the US government, to answer:&nbsp;</p><p>Of all the things that might be centralized and nationalized in this poor man&#8217;s life, should it really be his money?</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/cbdcs/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/cbdcs/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[9/12]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Greatest Regret Of My Life]]></description><link>https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/9-12</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/9-12</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 22:32:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e006dbe-a270-4504-8133-723fbec61516_1333x1000.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1000-1333" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e006dbe-a270-4504-8133-723fbec61516_1333x1000.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e006dbe-a270-4504-8133-723fbec61516_1333x1000.jpeg" width="1333" height="1000" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e006dbe-a270-4504-8133-723fbec61516_1333x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:1333,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1316962,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

For as long as I live, I&#8217;ll remember retracing my way up Canine Road&#8212;the road past the NSA&#8217;s headquarters&#8212;after the Pentagon was attacked. Madness poured out of the agency&#8217;s black glass towers, a tide of yelling, ringing cell phones, and cars revving up in the parking lots and fighting their way onto the street. At the moment of the worst terrorist attack in American history, the staff of the NSA&#8212;the major signals intelligence agency of the American Intelligence Community (IC)&#8212;was abandoning its work by the thousands, and I was swept up in the flood.</p><p>NSA director <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-surveillance-architecture-includes-collection-of-revealing-internet-phone-metadata/2013/06/15/e9bf004a-d511-11e2-b05f-3ea3f0e7bb5a_story.html">Michael Hayden</a><strong> </strong>issued the <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a930nsaevacuated#a930nsaevacuated">order to evacuate</a> before most of the country even knew what had happened. Subsequently, the NSA and the CIA&#8212;which also evacuated all but a skeleton crew from its own headquarters on 9/11&#8212;would explain their behavior by citing a concern that one of the agencies might potentially, possibly, perhaps be the target of the fourth and last hijacked airplane, United Airlines Flight 93, rather than, say, the White House or Capitol.</p><p>I sure as hell wasn&#8217;t thinking about the next likeliest targets as I crawled through the gridlock, with everyone trying to get their cars out of the same parking lot simultaneously. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about anything at all. What I was doing was obediently following along, in what today I recall as one totalizing moment&#8212;a clamor of horns (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever heard a car horn at an American military installation before) and out-of-phase radios shrieking the news of the South Tower&#8217;s collapse while the drivers steered with their knees and feverishly pressed redial on their phones. I can still feel it&#8212;the present-tense emptiness every time my call was dropped by an overloaded cell network, and the gradual realization that, cut off from the world and stalled bumper to bumper, even though I was in the driver&#8217;s seat, I was just a passenger.</p><p>The stoplights on Canine Road gave way to humans, as the NSA&#8217;s special police went to work directing traffic. In the ensuing hours, days, and weeks they&#8217;d be joined by convoys of Humvees topped with machine guns, guarding new roadblocks and checkpoints. Many of these new security measures became permanent, supplemented by endless rolls of wire and massive installations of surveillance cameras. With all this security, it became difficult for me to get back on base and drive past the NSA&#8212;until the day I was employed there.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>Try to remember the biggest family event you&#8217;ve ever been to&#8212;maybe a family reunion. How many people were there? Maybe 30, 50? Though all of them together comprise your family, you might not really have gotten the chance to know each and every individual member. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&#8217;s number</a>, the famous estimate of how many relationships you can meaningfully maintain in life, is just 150. Now think back to school. How many people were in your class in grade school, and in high school? How many of them were friends, and how many others did you just know as acquaintances, and how many still others did you simply recognize? If you went to school in the United States, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a thousand. It certainly stretches the boundaries of what you could say are all &#8220;your people,&#8221; but you may still have felt a bond with them.</p><p>Nearly three thousand people died on 9/11. Imagine everyone you love, everyone you know, even everyone with a familiar name or just a familiar face&#8212;and imagine they&#8217;re gone. Imagine the empty houses. Imagine the empty school, the empty classrooms. All those people you lived among, and who together formed the fabric of your days, just not there anymore. The events of 9/11 left holes. Holes in families, holes in communities. Holes in the ground.  </p><p>Now, consider this: <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2015/3/25/headlines/study_us_wars_have_left_over_1_million_dead_in_iraq_afghanistan_pakistan">over one million people</a> have been killed in the course of America&#8217;s response.</p><p>The two decades since 9/11 have been a litany of American destruction by way of American self-destruction, with the promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts, and secret wars, whose traumatizing impact&#8212;whose very existence&#8212;the US government has repeatedly classified, denied, disclaimed, and distorted. After having spent roughly half that period as an employee of the American Intelligence Community and roughly the other half in exile, I know better than most how often the agencies get things wrong. I know, too, how the collection and analysis of intelligence can inform the production of disinformation and propaganda, for use as frequently against America&#8217;s allies as its enemies&#8212;and sometimes against its own citizens. Yet even given that knowledge, I still struggle to accept the sheer magnitude and speed of the change, from an America that sought to define itself by a calculated and performative respect for dissent to a security state whose militarized police demand obedience, drawing their guns and issuing the order for total submission now heard in every city: &#8220;Stop resisting.&#8221;</p><p>This is why whenever I try to understand how the last two decades happened, I return to that September&#8212;to that ground-zero day and its immediate aftermath. To return to that fall means coming up against a truth darker than the lies that tied the Taliban to al-Qaeda and conjured up Saddam Hussein&#8217;s illusory stockpile of WMDs. It means, ultimately, confronting the fact that the carnage and abuses that marked my young adulthood were born not only in the executive branch and the intelligence agencies, but also in the hearts and minds of all Americans, myself included.</p><p>I remember escaping the panicked crush of the spies fleeing Fort Meade just as the North Tower came down. Once on the highway, I tried to steer with one hand while pressing buttons with the other, calling family indiscriminately and never getting through. Finally I managed to get in touch with my mother, who at this point in her career had left the NSA and was working as a clerk for the federal courts in Baltimore. They, at least, weren&#8217;t evacuating.</p><p>Her voice scared me, and suddenly the only thing in the world that mattered to me was reassuring her.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m headed off base,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s in New York, right?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&#8212;I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t get in touch with Gran.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Is Pop in Washington?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;He could be in the Pentagon for all I know.&#8221;</p><p>The breath went out of me. By 2001, Pop had retired from the Coast Guard and was now a senior official in the FBI, serving as one of the heads of its aviation section. This meant that he spent plenty of time in plenty of federal buildings throughout DC and its environs.</p><p>Before I could summon any words of comfort, my mother spoke again.&#8220;There&#8217;s someone on the other line. It might be Gran. I&#8217;ve got to go.&#8221;</p><p>When she didn&#8217;t call me back, I tried her number endlessly but couldn&#8217;t get through, so I went home to wait, sitting in front of the blaring TV while I kept reloading news sites. The new cable modem we had was quickly proving more resilient than all of the telecom satellites and cell towers, which were failing across the country.</p><p>My mother&#8217;s drive back from Baltimore was a slog through crisis traffic. She arrived in tears, but we were among the lucky ones. Pop was safe.</p><p>The next time we saw Gran and Pop, there was a lot of talk&#8212;about Christmas plans, about New Year&#8217;s plans&#8212;but the Pentagon and the towers were never mentioned.</p><p>My father, by contrast, vividly recounted his 9/11 to me. He was at Coast Guard Headquarters when the towers were hit, and he and three of his fellow officers left their offices in the Operations Directorate to find a conference room with a screen so they could watch the news coverage. A young officer rushed past them down the hall and said, &#8220;They just bombed the Pentagon.&#8221; Met with expressions of disbelief, the young officer repeated, &#8220;I&#8217;m serious&#8212;they just bombed the Pentagon.&#8221; My father hustled over to a wall-length window that gave him a view across the Potomac of about two-fifths of the Pentagon and swirling clouds of thick black smoke.</p><p>The more that my father related this memory, the more intrigued I became by the line: &#8220;They just bombed the Pentagon.&#8221; Every time he said it, I recall thinking, &#8220;They&#8221;? Who were &#8220;They&#8221;?</p><p>America immediately divided the world into &#8220;Us&#8221; and &#8220;Them,&#8221; and everyone was either with &#8220;Us&#8221; or against &#8220;Us,&#8221; as President Bush so memorably remarked even while the rubble was still smoldering. People in my neighborhood put up new American flags, as if to show which side they&#8217;d chosen. People hoarded red, white, and blue Dixie cups and stuffed them through every chain-link fence on every overpass of every highway between my mother&#8217;s home and my father&#8217;s, to spell out phrases like UNITED WE STAND and STAND TOGETHER NEVER FORGET.</p><p>I sometimes used to go to a shooting range and now alongside the old targets, the bull&#8217;s-eyes and flat silhouettes, were effigies of men in Arab headdress. Guns that had languished for years behind the dusty glass of the display cases were now marked SOLD. Americans also lined up to buy cell phones, hoping for advance warning of the next attack, or at least the ability to say good-bye from a hijacked flight.</p><p>Nearly a hundred thousand spies returned to work at the agencies with the knowledge that they&#8217;d failed at their primary job, which was protecting America. Think of the guilt they were feeling. They had the same anger as everybody else, but they also felt the guilt. An assessment of their mistakes could wait. What mattered most at that moment was that they redeem themselves. Meanwhile, their bosses got busy campaigning for extraordinary budgets and extraordinary powers, leveraging the threat of terror to expand their capabilities and mandates beyond the imagination not just of the public but even of those who stamped the approvals.</p><p>September 12 was the first day of a new era, which America faced with a unified resolve, strengthened by a revived sense of patriotism and the goodwill and sympathy of the world. In retrospect, my country could have done so much with this opportunity. It could have treated terror not as the theological phenomenon it purported to be, but as the crime it was. It could have used this rare moment of solidarity to reinforce democratic values and cultivate resilience in the now-connected global public.</p><p>Instead, it went to war.  </p><p>The greatest regret of my life is my reflexive, unquestioning support for that decision. I was outraged, yes, but that was only the beginning of a process in which my heart completely defeated my rational judgment. I accepted all the claims retailed by the media as facts, and I repeated them as if I were being paid for it. I wanted to be a liberator. I wanted to free the oppressed. I embraced the truth constructed for the good of the state, which in my passion I confused with the good of the country. It was as if whatever individual politics I&#8217;d developed had crashed&#8212;the anti-institutional hacker ethos instilled in me online, and the apolitical patriotism I&#8217;d inherited from my parents, both wiped from my system&#8212;and I&#8217;d been rebooted as a willing vehicle of vengeance. The sharpest part of the humiliation comes from acknowledging how easy this transformation was, and how readily I welcomed it.</p><p>I wanted, I think, to be part of something. Prior to 9/11, I&#8217;d been ambivalent about serving because it had seemed pointless, or just boring. Everyone I knew who&#8217;d served had done so in the post&#8211;Cold War world order, between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the attacks of 2001. In that span, which coincided with my youth, America lacked for enemies. The country I grew up in was the sole global superpower, and everything seemed&#8212;at least to me, or to people like me&#8212;prosperous and settled. There were no new frontiers to conquer or great civic problems to solve, except online. The attacks of 9/11 changed all that. Now, finally, there was a fight.</p><p>My options dismayed me, however. I thought I could best serve my country behind a terminal, but a normal IT job seemed too comfortable and safe for this new world of asymmetrical conflict. I hoped I could do something like in the movies or on TV&#8212;those hacker-versus-hacker scenes with walls of virus-warning blinkenlights, tracking enemies and thwarting their schemes. Unfortunately for me, the primary agencies that did that&#8212;the NSA, the CIA&#8212;had their hiring requirements written a half century ago and often rigidly required a traditional college degree, meaning that though the tech industry considered my <a href="https://www.aacc.edu/">AACC</a> credits and MCSE certification acceptable, the government wouldn&#8217;t. The more I read around online, however, the more I realized that the post-9/11 world was a world of exceptions. The agencies were growing so much and so quickly, especially on the technical side, that they&#8217;d sometimes waive the degree requirement for military veterans. It&#8217;s then that I decided to join up.</p><p>You might be thinking that my decision made sense, or was inevitable, given my family&#8217;s record of service. But it didn&#8217;t and it wasn&#8217;t. By enlisting, I was as much rebelling against that well-established legacy as I was conforming to it&#8212;because after talking to recruiters from every branch, I decided to join the army, whose leadership some in my Coast Guard family had always considered the crazy uncles of the US military.</p><p>When I told my mother, she cried for days. I knew better than to tell my father, who&#8217;d already made it very clear during hypothetical discussions that I&#8217;d be wasting my technical talents there. I was twenty years old; I knew what I was doing.</p><p>The day I left, I wrote my father a letter&#8212;handwritten, not typed&#8212;that explained my decision, and slipped it under the front door of his apartment. It closed with a statement that still makes me wince. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Dad,&#8221; I wrote, &#8220;but this is vital for my personal growth.&#8221;  </p><p></p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/9-12/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/9-12/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Covid, Climate, And The New Denialism]]></title><description><![CDATA[Denying facts: bad.

After all, the statistics on CNN, on FOX, and in <em>The New York Times</em>&#8212;someone&nbsp;Googled them too. That&#8217;s what the media has become: someone Googling <em>for you</em>.&nbsp;And yet whenever the media presents statistics, it somehow never manages to remind us&nbsp;that statistics are inherently uncertain. The field of statistics is literally&nbsp;<em>the study of uncertainty</em>, of possible or probable likelihoods (or <em>un</em>likelihoods), which are ten-out-of-ten times presented as the personally-applicable percentage chances, the Vegas odds that X or Y will (or will not) happen to <strong>YOU</strong>.</p><p>For many of us, to read the daily news is to assess our personal risk-levels and yet we&nbsp;rarely recall&#8212;and the media never mentions&#8212;that the true challenge&nbsp;is not to enumerate the risk, but to live with it; to stake out the resilient&nbsp;middle ground between denying danger altogether (and, say, refusing to wear a mask in a crowded train or bus)&nbsp;and finding nothing but danger everywhere (and, say, wearing a mask and gloves when alone in the middle of the woods).</p><p>The way we assess risk is inextricable from the way we process fear, and it is one of the many factors that determines our paranoia and susceptibility to conspiracy. Anti-vaxxers fear the vaccine (which saves lives) more than the disease (which ends or impairs them); climate-denying politicians fear the economic consequences of climate adaptation more than... <em>the end of the world</em>, which, you know, might have some impact on the portfolio.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-980-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a4428c-bd88-4e26-a5fa-1438e4aeb5c4_1484x999.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a4428c-bd88-4e26-a5fa-1438e4aeb5c4_1484x999.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84a4428c-bd88-4e26-a5fa-1438e4aeb5c4_1484x999.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:980,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:256262,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

This new offensive is tentatively slated to begin with the launch of iOS 15&#8288;&#8212;almost certainly in mid-September&#8288;&#8212;with the devices of its US user-base designated as the initial targets. We&#8217;re told that other countries will be spared, but not for long.</p><p>You might have noticed that I haven&#8217;t mentioned which problem it&nbsp;is that Apple is purporting to solve. Why? Because it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><p>Having read thousands upon thousands of remarks on this growing scandal,&nbsp;it has become clear to me that many understand it doesn't matter, but few if any have been willing to actually say it. Speaking candidly, if that&#8217;s still allowed, that&#8217;s the way it always goes when someone of institutional significance launches a campaign to defend an indefensible intrusion into our private spaces. They make a mad dash to the supposed high ground, from which they speak in low, solemn tones about their moral mission before fervently invoking the dread spectre of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Infopocalypse</a>, warning that only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">dubious amulet</a>&#8212;or suspicious software update&#8212;can save us from the most threatening members of our species. </p><p>Suddenly, everybody with a principled objection is forced to preface their concern with apologetic throat-clearing and the establishment of bonafides: <em>I lost a friend when the towers came down, however...

Apple dispatched its SVP-for-Software Ken doll to speak with the <em>Journal&nbsp;</em>not to protect the company's users, but to reassure the company's investors. His role was to create the false impression that this is not something that you, or anyone, should be upset about.&nbsp;And, collaterally,&nbsp;his role was to ensure this new "policy" would be associated with the face of an Apple executive other than&nbsp;CEO Tim Cook, just in case the roll-out, or the fall-out, results in a corporate beheading.</p><p>Why? Why is Apple risking so much for a CSAM-detection system that has been denounced as &#8220;dangerous&#8221; and "easily repurposed for surveillance and censorship" by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/19/apple-csam-abuse-encryption-security-privacy-dangerous/">the very computer scientists who've already put it to the test</a>? What could be worth the decisive shattering of the foundational Apple idea that an iPhone belongs to the person who carries it, rather than to the company that made it?&nbsp; </p><p>Apple: "Designed in California, Assembled in China, Purchased by You, Owned by Us."</p><p>The one answer to these questions that the optimists keep coming back to&nbsp;is the likelihood that Apple is doing this as a prelude to finally switching over to <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/deep-dive-end-end-encryption-how-do-public-key-encryption-systems-work">&#8220;end-to-end&#8221; encryption</a> for everything its customers store on iCloud&#8212;something Apple had previously intended to do before backtracking, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT">in a dismaying&nbsp;display of cowardice</a>, after the FBI secretly complained.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, what I&#8217;m describing here as end-to-end encryption is a somewhat complex concept, but briefly, it means that only the two endpoints sharing a file&#8212;say, two phones on opposite sides of the internet&#8212;are able to&nbsp;decrypt it. Even if the file were being stored and served from an iCloud server in Cupertino, as far as Apple (or any other middleman-in-a-handsome-suit) is concerned, that file is just an indecipherable blob of random garbage: the file only becomes a text message, a video, a photo, or whatever it is, when it is paired with a key that&#8217;s possessed only by you and by those with whom you choose to share it. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-341-524" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fdfec14-9cf9-4bd5-9137-169234d2d774_1100x714.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fdfec14-9cf9-4bd5-9137-169234d2d774_1100x714.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fdfec14-9cf9-4bd5-9137-169234d2d774_1100x714.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:714,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:524,&quot;bytes&quot;:16568,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

This would mean that even Apple itself could no longer be expected to rummage through your iCloud account with its grabby little raccoon hands&#8212;and therefore could not be expected to hand it over to any government that can stamp a sheet of paper, which is precisely why the FBI (again: secretly) complained.</p><p>For Apple to realize this original vision would have represented a <em>huge</em> improvement in the privacy of our devices, effectively delivering the&nbsp;final word in a thirty year-long debate over&nbsp;establishing a new industry standard&#8212;and, by extension, the new global expectation that parties seeking access to data from a device must <em>obtain it</em> from that device, rather than turning the internet and its ecosystem into a spy machine.</p><p>Unfortunately, I am here to report that once again, the optimists are&nbsp;wrong: Apple&#8217;s proposal to make their phones inform on and betray their owners marks the dawn of a dark future, one to be written in the blood of the political opposition of a hundred countries that will exploit this system to the hilt.

Our pattern recognition capabilities are a key determinant in defining intelligence. But we now live in a dystopian digital landscape purpose-built to undermine these capabilities, training us to mistake planned patterns for convenient and even meaningful coincidences.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You know the drill: email a colleague about the shit weather and start getting banner ads for cheap flights to Corsica (I hear it&#8217;s nice?); google "ordination license" or "city hall hours" and watch your inbox fill with rebates for rings and cribs. For those of us who grew up during the rise of surveillance capitalism, our online experience has been defined by the effort of separating coincidence from cause-and-effect. Today we understand, if not accept, that hyper-consumption of information online comes at the cost of being hyper-<em>consumed</em>, bled by tech companies for the that data our readings secrete: You click, and the Big Five scrape a sample of your &#8220;preferences&#8221;&#8212;to exploit.<br></p><p>The real cost to this recursive construction of reality from the ephemera of our preferences is that it tailors a separate world for each individual. <br></p><p>And when you <em>do</em> live at the center of a private world, reverse-engineered from your own search history, you begin to notice patterns that others can&#8217;t.

To manufacture meaning from mere coincidence is the essence of paranoia, the gateway to world-building your own private conspiracies&#8212;or else to an epiphany that allows you to see the world as it actually is. <br></p><p>I want to talk about that epiphany, about taking back control of our atomized, pre-conspiracy world.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>The German psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Conrad">Klaus Conrad</a> called this premonitory state <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a></em>, defined as perceiving patterns that don't actually exist and referring them back to an unseen authority who must be pulling the strings. It&#8217;s a theory he developed as an army medical officer specializing in head traumas under the Third Reich. Today, it&#8217;s analogized to political conspiracy thinking. <br></p><p>Consider Case No. 10: a German soldier at a filling station refuses to service a patrol that doesn&#8217;t have the proper paperwork. Chalk his behavior up to that infamous Nazi officiousness, but when the patrol returns, papers in hand, the soldier still refuses to obey orders. His pattern recognition has gone into overdrive, and he&#8217;s begun to see every detail&#8212;a locked door, these patrolmen, papers signed or unsigned&#8212;as a test. His paranoid disobedience lands him in the psych ward, where Conrad writes him up as one of 107 cases that revolutionizes the Germano-sphere&#8217;s understanding of human psychology.<br></p><p>Conrad became famous for recognizing this oppressive emergence of patterns as a pre-psychotic state that he compared to stage-fright. It culminates in a false epiphany: an <em>apophany</em> is not a flash of insight into the true nature of reality but an aha experience (literally: <em>Aha-Erlebnis</em>) that constitutes the birth of delusion. The entire universe has &#8220;turned back&#8221; and &#8220;reorganized itself&#8221; to revolve around the individual, performing and corroborating his suspicions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p>Shakespeare said that all the world&#8217;s a stage. But in this case it&#8217;s staged specifically for <em>you</em>, <strong>the audience who's also the star.</strong><br></p><p>For someone obsessed with the pathology of conspiracy, Conrad was pretty susceptible to conspiratorial thinking&nbsp;himself. Born in Germany and raised in Vienna, his loyalties to the Nazi Party preceded his military duty. He joined in 1940 when his earlier research in hereditary epilepsy looked like promising fodder for the Nazi's monstrous sterilization laws. Maybe it was careerist opportunism, maybe it was ideological. Or maybe it takes one delusion-obsessed man to recognize another: Hitler was one of greatest conspiracy theorists of all time. <br></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-449-600" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca182d52-370f-4d1b-b985-7c6777405567_600x449.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca182d52-370f-4d1b-b985-7c6777405567_600x449.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca182d52-370f-4d1b-b985-7c6777405567_600x449.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:449,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9909,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

In fact he ended up being one of the only Nazi scientists to be producing science without rockets, torture, or pentagrams.

Instant advertising was supposed to yield informed consumers; the National Security Agency was supposed to protect "us" by exploiting "them."&nbsp;These plans went horribly wrong. But once you wake up to the idea that the world has been patterned, intentionally or unintentionally, in ways you don&#8217;t agree with, you can begin to change it. </p><p><br>It is in good faith that whistleblowers around the world bring these contradictions to public attention; they facilitate public epiphany, reminding us that we&#8217;re not quarantined in our private, paranoid &#8220;stages.&#8221; Thinking in public, together, allows us to stage a different performance entirely. We become more like Popper&#8217;s social theorists:<br></p><p><em>The conspiracy theorist will believe that institutions can be understood completely as the result of conscious design; and as collectives, he usually ascribes to them a kind of group-personality, treating them as conspiring agents, just as if they were individual men. As opposed to this view, <strong>the social theorist should recognize that the persistence of institutions and collectives creates a problem to be solved </strong>in terms of an analysis of individual social actions and their unintended (and often unwanted) social consequences, as well as their intended ones.</em><br></p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m the deluded one for finding reason for optimism in this idea&#8212;and not only because it saves me from letting the former Nazi Conrad&nbsp;have the last word. Popper&#8217;s thinking offers an escape hatch from our private worlds and back into the public sphere. The social theorist is a public thinker, oriented toward improving society; the conspiracy theorist is a victim of institutions that lie beyond their control.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/conspiracy-pt2?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[Q&A #02] Bombs vs. Bugs]]></title><description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ll be taking some time in the next months to talk about the newly hostile-by-default nature of technology, and how I deal with it.]]></description><link>https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/qa02</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/qa02</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 22:07:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e0f016c-39a3-44ba-b40b-961c1dbf5b4e_1854x1266.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>One of the interesting things for me about this shared space of ours is to be able to see what it is that you most enjoy&#8212;or don&#8217;t&#8212;and where your questions lie.

<em>While I agree that they need to be stopped, I'm worried about what consequences it might have to ban code. I personally view code as a form of free speech, but I am not sure what implications it might have to ban specific forms of code.</em></code></pre><p></p><p>I struggle with this question quite a bit myself. It&#8217;s apparent to me that just as we cannot trust governments to decide the things that can and cannot be said, we should not empower them to start permitting the applications that we can write (or install). <em>However, </em>we also have to recognize that until your neighbors are lining up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storming_of_the_Bastille">storm the Bastille</a>, we&#8217;re forced to respond to policy crises within the context of the system that currently exists. </p><p>The government <em>already</em> manages to (unconstitutionally) regulate speech in the United States through various means: we need look no further for examples than the Espionage Act, or the abuse of state secrecy to prevent any accountability for those involved in the CIA&#8217;s recent torture program. I&#8217;m fairly confident that you could watch any arbitrary White House Press Conference today to witness indicia of that continuing impulse <a href="https://reason.com/2021/07/21/biden-is-trying-to-impose-online-censorship-by-proxy/">applied to new controversies</a>. And as you say, outside the United States, circumstances are often similar or worse.</p><p>How, then, do we restrain the governmental impulse to reward cronies and punish inconvenient voices in the context of something as complex as exploit code? If we&#8217;re going to ensure publicly harmful activity (the insecurity industry) is impacted while exempting the publicly beneficial&#8212;defenders, researchers, and uncountable categories of benign tinkerers&#8212;we need to identify some variable that is always present in category A, but not strictly required by category B.</p><p>And we have that, here. That thing is the profit motive.</p><p>Nobody goes to work at the NSO Group to save the world. They do it to get rich. They can&#8217;t do that without the ability to <em>sell</em> the exploits they develop far and wide. You ban the <em>commercial trade </em>in exploit code, and they&#8217;re out of business. </p><p>In contrast, a researcher at the University of Michigan writing a paper on iOS exploitation or some kid on a farm trying to repair their family&#8217;s indefensibly DRM-locked John Deere tractor is not going to be deterred from doing that just because they can&#8217;t sell the result to the most recent cover model for <em>Repressive Dictator</em> magazine.</p><p>That&#8217;s the crucial caveat that I think many missed regarding my call for a global moratorium: it is a prohibition on the <em>commercial trade&#8212;</em>that is to say, specifically the for-profit exploitation of society at large, which is the raison d&#8217;etre of the insecurity industry<em>&#8212;</em>rather than the mere development, production, or use of exploit code. My proposal here is in fact closer to an <em>inversion</em> of the government&#8217;s response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Distributed#Legal_challenges">Defense Distributed</a>, where it sought to reflexively ban the mere transmission of information without regard to motivation, use, or consequence. </p><p></p><div><hr></div><pre><code><strong>Eoan</strong> writes:</code></pre><pre><code>Which is more likely to kill someone if allowed to be sold: a software exploit or a 250-kg air-dropped bomb?</code></pre><p></p><p>I think this misses the point. Beyond the question of &#8220;how do they know where to drop the bomb?&#8221;, there&#8217;s a more important one: &#8220;<strong>which of these is more likely to be used?&#8221; </strong></p><p>Bombs are blunt instruments, the <em>ultima ratio regum </em>of a state that has exhausted its ability<em>&#8212;</em>or appetite<em>&#8212;</em>to engage in less visible forms of coercion. They are at least <em>intended</em> to be the very end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain">kill-chain</a>, the warhead-on-forehead that erases the inconvenient problem. </p><p>Software exploits, in contrast, are at the very top of that chain. They are the means by which a state decides who and where to bomb<em>&#8212;</em>if it even gets that far, since spying provides an <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128">unusual menu</a> of options for escalation. <a href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/ns-oh-god-how-is-this-legal">As I mentioned</a>, a software vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly, widely, and nearly invisibly. Unlike a bomb, if an exploit generates a headline, it will most probably happen years later instead of on that evening&#8217;s news. The result is that spying is <em>far more common </em>than bombing, and in many ways becoming prerequisite to it. </p><p>Another little-understood property that make exploits more dangerous than bombs&#8212;and they definitely are&#8212;is that, as with the viral strain of a biological weapon, as soon as an adversary catches a sample of an exploit, they can perfectly reproduce it... and then use it themselves against anyone they want.</p><p>When you fire a rocket or drop a bomb, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the target catching it and throwing it back at you. But with exploits, every time you use it, you run the risk of losing it.</p><p>All of this is to say that while we can&#8217;t stop the sale of bombs, when the Saudis then drop that bomb on someone, we know that it happened, we often know who made it (from the markings on exploded fragments at the scene), we normally know who dropped it, and we know who it was dropped on. In the vast majority  of cases involving the insecurity industry&#8217;s hacking-for-hire, not one of these details are known to us, and all of them are important in providing for the possibility of enforcing accountability for misuse.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Insecurity Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[The greatest danger to national security has become the companies claiming to protect it]]></description><link>https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/ns-oh-god-how-is-this-legal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/ns-oh-god-how-is-this-legal</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 20:38:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbde2e49-ed55-4cc0-8252-0ad447f7c8f0_780x520.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-520-780" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbde2e49-ed55-4cc0-8252-0ad447f7c8f0_780x520.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbde2e49-ed55-4cc0-8252-0ad447f7c8f0_780x520.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbde2e49-ed55-4cc0-8252-0ad447f7c8f0_780x520.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:520,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:40143,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

Each country denounces the others&#8217; efforts as a crime, while refusing to admit culpability for its own infractions. How, then, can we claim to be surprised when Jamaica shows up with its own bobsled team? Or when a private company calling itself &#8220;Jamaica&#8221; shows up and claims the same right to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/15/spyware-company-impersonates-activist-groups-black-lives-matter">cool runnings</a>&#8221; as a nation-state?<br></p><p>If hacking is not illegal when we do it, then it will not be illegal when they do it&#8212;and &#8220;they&#8221; is increasingly becoming the private sector. It&#8217;s a basic principle of capitalism: it&#8217;s just business. If everyone else is doing it, why not me?<br></p><p>This is the superficially logical reasoning that has produced pretty much every proliferation problem in the history of arms control, and the same mutually assured destruction implied by a nuclear conflict is <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/">all-but guaranteed</a> in a digital one, due to the network&#8217;s interconnectivity, and homogeneity. <br></p><p>Recall our earlier topic of the NSO Group&#8217;s Pegasus, which especially but not exclusively targets iPhones. While iPhones are more private by default and, occasionally, better-engineered from a security perspective than Google&#8217;s Android operating system, they also constitute a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ios-14-installation-rates-june-2021/">monoculture</a>: if you find a way to infect one of them, you can (probably) infect all of them, a problem exacerbated by Apple&#8217;s black-box refusal to permit customers to make any meaningful modifications to the way iOS&nbsp;devices operate. When you combine this monoculture and black-boxing&nbsp;with Apple&#8217;s nearly universal popularity among the global elite,&nbsp;the reasons for the NSO Group&#8217;s iPhone fixation become apparent.<br></p><p>Governments must come to understand that permitting&#8212;much less subsidizing&#8212;the existence of the NSO Group and its malevolent peers does not serve their interests, regardless of where the client, or the client-state, is situated along the&nbsp;authoritarian axis: the last President of the United States spent all of his time in office when he wasn&#8217;t playing golf <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/trump-phone-security-risk-hackers-601903">tweeting from an iPhone</a>, and I would wager that half of the most senior officials and their associates in every <em>other</em> country were reading those tweets on <em>their</em> iPhones (maybe on the golf course).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Whether we like it or not, adversaries and allies share a common environment, and with each passing day, we become increasingly dependent on devices that run a common code. <br></p><p>The idea that the great powers of our era&#8212;America, China, Russia, even Israel&#8212;are interested in, say,&nbsp;Azerbaijian attaining strategic parity in intelligence-gathering is, of course, profoundly mistaken. These governments have simply failed to grasp the threat,&nbsp;because the capability-gap hasn&#8217;t vanished&#8212;yet.<br></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>4.</strong></h3><p>In technology as in public health, to protect anyone, we must protect everyone. The first step in this direction&#8212;at least the first digital step&#8212;must be to ban&nbsp;the commercial trade in intrusion software. We do not permit a market in biological infections-as-a-service, and the same must be true for digital infections. Eliminating the profit motive reduces the risks of proliferation while protecting progress, leaving room for publicly-minded research and inherently governmental work.<br></p><p>While removing intrusion software from the commercial market doesn&#8217;t also take it away from states, it <em>does</em> ensure that reckless drug dealers and sex-criminal Hollywood producers who can dig a few million out of their couch cushions won&#8217;t be able to infect any or every iPhone on the planet, endangering the&nbsp;latte-class&#8217; shiny slabs of status.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Such a moratorium, however, is mere triage: it only buys us time. Following a ban, the next step is liability.&nbsp;It is crucial to understand that neither the scale of the NSO Group&#8217;s business, nor the consequences it has inflicted on global society, would have been possible without access to global capital from amoral firms like Novalpina Capital (Europe) and Francisco Partners (US). The slogan is simple: if companies are not divested, the owners should be arrested. The exclusive product of this industry is intentional, foreseeable harm, and these companies are witting accomplices.

    <strong>Jonathan T / ChumbaRoomba</strong> ask:</code></pre><pre><code>What if instead of Conspiracy enabling individuals to abdicate from the making of truth-value judgments, Conspiracy Practice and Conspiracy Theory emerge from an interwoven tapestry of narratives formed of the truth-value judgments of a multitude of individuals&#8212;and only when examined holistically in the context of the knowns and unknowns of history can we see who made good judgments based on true or false facts and who made bad ones? ...How do we sort True conspiracies from False? </code></pre><p></p><p>This is a great question, and one I still struggle with. To put it in my own terms: could it be that what I regard as the malevolence of conspiracy practice and the ignorance of conspiracy theory simply stems from well-meaning people adhering to, and making decisions based on, what they regard as their truth? </p><p>I&#8217;m not sure I have a decent answer. Certainly the secular world has this experience when dealing with extremist religious groups. How can an athiest tell a true believer that they are wrong, when they claim the authority of a god? Contemporary politics are, to my mind, similarly as much or more a test of faith than an examination of fact. The core problem is to identify a space where the definition of truth can be narrowed to some set of facts that can be measured, tested&#8212;verified, from the latin <em>verificare</em>: to make true. </p><p>Too often we forget that the unverified is, quite literally, not truly "true." It can still be reasonable, and even probable, but fact unverified is no fact at all, a circumstance made all the more difficult in a moment when the truth has become emotionalized or psychologized, and increasingly confused for what&#8217;s more accurately called &#8220;belief.&#8221; <br></p><div><hr></div><p></p><pre><code><strong>
    Thomas Moller-Nielsen </strong>asks:</code></pre><pre><code>I don&#8217;t quite see how the Liar&#8217;s Paradox is supposed to relate to the issue of self-censorship. As I understand it, The Liar&#8217;s Paradox involves sentences which cannot be either true or false without entailing a contradiction. (&#8220;This sentence is false&#8221;, if true, is false, and if false, it is true.) Self-censorship, on the other hand, involves refraining from publicly uttering one&#8217;s beliefs due to fear of possible negative social/political/economic/consequences. But what does the former have to do with the latter? What is logically paradoxical about failing to publicly air one&#8217;s views?</code></pre><p><br>It has been said that I'm prone to failures of elaboration. In this case, I invoked the Liar&#8217;s Paradox to describe and contextualize the role not of the writer or speaker but of the reader or listener: In a culture of self-censorship, how do we who consume news and opinion know what to believe? How can we tell when someone is being honest (or thinks they&#8217;re being honest)? Self-censorship doesn&#8217;t just prevent communicators from expressing themselves freely. It eventually erodes the trust of the public&#8212;the true &#8220;silent majority&#8221; who might not have a platform, or want a platform, from which to speak, but who rely on the voices of others to inform them. <br></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p></p><pre><code><strong>    Larsiusprime</strong> asks:</code></pre><pre><code>Ed&#8212;how much do you think the current state of the internet is due to the surveillance impetus of state actors, and how much [to] private forces?

These tools, which were developed by the Israeli state&#8212;or more accurately those recently in the employ of the Israeli state&#8212;were sold by NSO, nominally a private company.

Counterintuitively, these conspiracies are more often than not announced in public&nbsp;and with a modicum of pride. They&#8217;re dutifully reported in our newspapers; they&#8217;re bannered onto the covers of our magazines; updates on their progress are scrolled across our screens &#8212;&nbsp; all with such regularity as to render us unable to relate the banality of their methods to the rapacity of their ambitions.</p><p>The party in power wants to redraw district lines. The prime interest rate has changed. A free service has been created to host our personal files. These conspiracies order, and disorder, our lives; and yet they can&#8217;t compete for attention with digital graffiti about pedophile Satanists in the basement of a DC pizzeria.</p><p>This, in sum, is our problem: the truest conspiracies meet with the least opposition.</p><p>Or to put it another way, <em>conspiracy practices</em> &#8212; the methods by which true conspiracies&nbsp;such as gerrymandering, or the debt industry, or mass surveillance are realized &#8212; are almost always overshadowed by <em>conspiracy theories</em>: those malevolent falsehoods that in aggregate can erode civic confidence in the existence of anything certain or verifiable.</p><p>In my life, I&#8217;ve had enough of both the practice and the theory.&nbsp;In my work for the United States National Security Agency, I was involved with establishing a Top-Secret system intended to access and track the communications of every human being on the planet.

Call this elite the Deep State, or the Swamp; call it the Illuminati, or Opus Dei, or the Jews, or merely call it the major banking institutions and the Federal Reserve&nbsp;&#8212; the point is, a conspiracy is an inherently anti-democratic force.</p><p>The recognition of a conspiracy &#8212; again, whether true or false &#8212; entails accepting that not only are things&nbsp;other than what they seem, but they are systematized, regulated, intentional, and even logical. It&#8217;s only by treating conspiracies not as &#8220;plans&#8221; or &#8220;schemes&#8221; but as mechanisms for ordering the disordered that we can hope to understand how they have so radically displaced the concepts of &#8220;rights&#8221; and &#8220;freedoms&#8221; as the fundamental signifiers of democratic citizenship.</p><p>In democracies today, what is important to an increasing many is not what rights and freedoms&nbsp;are recognized, but what <em>beliefs</em> are respected: what history, or story, undergirds their identities as citizens, and as members of religious, racial, and ethnic communities. It&#8217;s this replacement-function of false conspiracies &#8212; the way they replace unified or majoritarian histories with parochial and partisan stories &#8212; that prepares the stage for political upheaval.</p><p>Especially pernicious is the way that false conspiracies absolve their followers of engaging with the truth. Citizenship in a conspiracy-society doesn&#8217;t require evaluating a statement of proposed fact for its truth-value, and then accepting it or rejecting it accordingly, so much as it requires the complete and total rejection of all truth-value that comes from an enemy source, and the substitution of an alternative plot, narrated from elsewhere.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The concept of the enemy is fundamental to conspiracy thinking&nbsp;&#8212; and to the various taxonomies of conspiracy itself. <a href="https://reason.com/people/jesse-walker/">Jesse Walker</a>, an editor at&nbsp;<em>Reason&nbsp;</em>and author of&nbsp;<em>The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory&nbsp;</em>(2013), offers the following categories of enemy-based conspiracy thinking:<br></p><ul><li><p>&#8220;Enemy Outside,&#8221; which pertains to conspiracy theories perpetrated by or based on actors scheming against a given identity-community <em>from&nbsp;outside of it</em><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;Enemy Within,&#8221; which pertains to conspiracy theories perpetrated by or based on actors scheming against a given identity-community <em>from&nbsp;inside of it</em><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;Enemy Above,&#8221; which pertains to&nbsp;conspiracy theories perpetrated by or based on actors manipulating events from within the circles of power (government, military, the intelligence community, etc.)<br></p></li><li><p>"Enemy Below," which pertains to&nbsp;conspiracy theories perpetrated by or based on actors from historically disenfranchised communities seeking to overturn the social order<br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;Benevolent Conspiracies,&#8221; which pertains to extra-terrestrial, supernatural, or religious&nbsp;forces dedicated to controlling the world for humanity's benefit (similar forces from Beyond who work to the detriment of humanity Walker might categorize under &#8220;Enemy Above&#8221;)<br></p></li></ul><p>Other forms of conspiracy-taxonomy are just a Wikipedia link away: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barkun">Michael Barkun's trinary categorization</a> of Event conspiracies (e.g. false-flags), Systemic conspiracies (e.g. Freemasons), and Superconspiracy theories (e.g. New World Order), as well as his distinction between the secret acts of secret groups and the secret acts of known groups; or Murray Rothbard's <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/20_2_2.pdf">binary of &#8220;shallow&#8221; and &#8220;deep&#8221; conspiracies</a> (&#8220;shallow&#8221; conspiracies begin by identifying evidence of wrongdoing and end by blaming the party that benefits; &#8220;deep&#8221; conspiracies begin by suspecting a party of wrongdoing and continue by seeking out documentary proof &#8212; or at least &#8220;documentary proof&#8221;). </p><p>I find things to admire in all of these taxonomies, but it strikes me as notable that none makes provision for truth-value. Further, I'm not sure that these or any mode of classification can adequately address the often-alternating, dependent nature of conspiracies, whereby a true conspiracy (e.g. the 9/11 hijackers) triggers a false conspiracy (e.g. 9/11 was an inside job), and a false conspiracy (e.g. Iraq has weapons of mass destruction) triggers a true conspiracy (e.g. the invasion of&nbsp;Iraq).</p><p>Another critique I would offer of the extant taxonomies involves a reassessment of&nbsp;causality, which is more properly the province of psychology and philosophy. Most of the taxonomies of conspiracy-thinking are based on the logic that most intelligence agencies use when&nbsp;they&nbsp;spread disinformation, treating falsity and fiction as levers of influence and confusion that can plunge a populace into powerlessness, making them vulnerable to new beliefs &#8212; and even new governments.</p><p>But this top-down approach fails to take into account that the predominant conspiracy theories in America today are developed from the bottom-up, plots concocted not behind the closed doors of intelligence agencies but on the open Internet by private citizens, by&nbsp;people.&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;</p><h4>In sum,&nbsp;conspiracy theories do not inculcate powerlessness, so much as they are the signs and symptoms of powerlessness itself.&nbsp;<br></h4><p>This leads us to those other taxonomies, which classify conspiracies not by their content, or intent, but by the desires that cause one to subscribe to them. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721417718261">Note, in particular</a>, the epistemic/existential/social triad of system-justification: Belief in a conspiracy is considered &#8220;epistemic&#8221; if the desire underlying the belief is to get at &#8220;the truth,&#8221; for its own sake; belief in a conspiracy is considered &#8220;existential&#8221; if the desire underlying the belief is to feel safe and secure, under another's control; while belief in a conspiracy is considered &#8220;social&#8221; if the desire underlying the belief is to develop a positive self-image, or a sense of belonging to a community.  </p><p>From Outside, from Within, from Above, from Below, from Beyond...events, systems, superconspiracies...shallow and deep heuristics...these are all attempts to chart a new type of politics that is also a new type of identity, a confluence of politics and identity that imbues all aspects of contemporary life. Ultimately, the only truly honest taxonomical approach to conspiracy-thinking that I can come up with is something of an inversion: the idea that&nbsp;<em><strong>conspiracies themselves are a taxonomy</strong></em>, a method by which democracies especially sort themselves into parties and tribes, a typology through which people who lack definite or satisfactory narratives as citizens explain to themselves their immiseration, their disenfranchisement, their lack of power, and even their lack of will.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Continuing Ed  &#8212; with Edward Snowden&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Continuing Ed  &#8212; with Edward Snowden</span></a></p><p><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Most Dangerous Censorship]]></title><description><![CDATA[Invisible but present, and far from the eyes of the public]]></description><link>https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/on-censorship-pt-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/on-censorship-pt-1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 19:03:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1bb4c60-a43c-4327-83d5-5c5fe058d65b_1920x1040.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-789-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1bb4c60-a43c-4327-83d5-5c5fe058d65b_1920x1040.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1bb4c60-a43c-4327-83d5-5c5fe058d65b_1920x1040.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c1bb4c60-a43c-4327-83d5-5c5fe058d65b_1920x1040.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1025123,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

What exactly did these words mean? They were probably supposed to indicate that the country from which it came was free of censorship. But it could also mean that letters </em><strong>not</strong><em> bearing this stamp </em>were<em> censored, a token of the selective nature of this office, which apparently mistrusts certain citizens while trusting others. It could naturally also mean that all letters bearing this stamp actually did pass through the censor's hand. At any rate, this symbolic and ambiguous stamp gives a profound insight into the nature of censorship, which on the one hand wants to establish its rightfulness, while at the same time attempting to camouflage its very existence. For, while censorship considers itself a historical necessity and an institution destined to defend public order and the ruling political party, it does not like to admit that it is there. It sees itself as a temporary evil, to be applied during a state of war. Censorship, then, is only a transitory measure which will be scrapped as soon as all those people who write letters, books, etc are politically mature and responsible, thus exonerating the State and its representatives from having to act as guardians of their citizens. </em><br></p><p>Such is the opening of <em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03064228608534021">Censorship/Self censorship</a></em>, a landmark essay by the Serbian-Yugoslav writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Ki%C5%A1">Danilo Ki&#353;</a>, who was born in Subotica, on the Hungarian-Yugoslav border&nbsp;in 1935&nbsp;and died in Paris in 1989.</p><p>Published in English in an anonymous translation in 1986, Ki&#353;'s essay on censorship is something akin to a personal manifesto, and builds on the work of numerous other dissidents of the Cold War milieu&nbsp;who sought to elucidate a certain power-structure in the dreaded Soviet censorship system that prevented their books from being published&nbsp;and their films and TV shows from being made. Dissidents in closed or closing societies naturally come to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Voluntary_Servitude">the 16th-century wisdom of &#201;tienne de La Bo&#233;tie</a>: the State is an abstraction, which depends on citizens &#8212; individuals &#8212; to execute its will. <br><br>Ki&#353; was intrigued by the manner of this execution. His systemization of censorship was tripartite and hierarchal: at the top was the official apparatus &#8212; the various bureaus tasked with formulating and enforcing the rules and policies. Below that official level&nbsp;was the&nbsp;publicly legible or popular level, the world of media outlets like newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses, which employ publishers and editors to police their pages.&nbsp;In Ki&#353;'s view, the very reason that publishers and editors can perform the tasks of censorship is because they are &#8220;not only censors,&#8221; but...publishers and editors.&nbsp;&#8203;&#8203;Their official titles give them cover in performing the work the state demands of them, which is not shaping and creating writing, but deforming and destroying it. Finally, at the bottom of Ki&#353;'s hierarchy are what he calls the &#8220;last resort&#8221;: the printers, who, &#8220;as the most responsible elements of the working classes, will simply refuse to print the incriminated text.&#8221;</p><p>Yet the apparatus of censorship doesn&#8217;t end there. There is also what I might call the &#8220;first resort,&#8221; those censors who exist below everyone, and yet above everyone too: the author who self-censors &#8212; a figure who in contemporary Internet&nbsp;terms might be called the &#8220;creator,&#8221; or &#8220;maker.&#8221; This figure is me &#8212; and this figure is you. It&#8217;s someone who takes the burden of censorship unto themselves, without any official censor or cover-censor commanding them. In Ki&#353;'s estimation, this figure threatens to become the ultimate vessel or incarnation of the State, a person who has internalized its oppressions and works them on themselves. According to Ki&#353;, the more censorship happens at this level &#8212; at the Marxist level of production, or at the level of your posting on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter&nbsp;&#8212; the more the presence of censorship, indeed the more the very existence&nbsp;of censorship, is hidden from the public. </p><p>Think about it: if the suppression is happening in your own home, if you're suppressing your own speech, who will know? And how can you ever call for help?</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h4><strong>II.</strong></h4><p>The Liar's Paradox, attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eubulides">Eubulides</a>, is famous in philosophy and logic. Its classic expression is as follows: &#8220;This sentence is a lie.&#8221; How to evaluate the sentence's truthfulness? Can it be evaluated? Any attempt to do so leads to paradox.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the same paradox that underlies&nbsp;all attempts to discuss censorship with the censored, and especially self-censorship with the self-censoring. How to begin? With what? <em>NIE CENZUROWANO: </em>&#8220;This statement is not censored.&#8221;</p><p>Ki&#353;, who narrowly escaped the Holocaust and whose work was eventually suppressed in&nbsp;Yugoslavia, wrote passionately on this struggle:</p><p><em>Whichever way you look at it, censorship is the tangible manifestation of a pathological state, the symptom of a chronic illness which develops side by side with it: self-censorship. Invisible but present, far from the eyes of the public, buried deep down in the most secret parts of the spirit, it is far more efficient than [official] censorship. While both of them induce (or are induced?) by the same means &#8212; threats, fear, blackmail &#8212; this second ill camouflages, or at any rate does not denounce, the existence of any outside constraint. The fight against censorship is open and dangerous, therefore heroic, while the battle against self-censorship is anonymous, lonely and unwitnessed, and it makes its subject feel humiliated and ashamed of collaborating. </em><br></p><p><em>Self-censorship means reading your own text with the eyes of another person, a situation where you become your own judge, stricter and more suspicious than anyone else. You the author know what no outside censor could ever discover: your most secret, unspoken thoughts which nonetheless you feel must be obvious to others &#8220;between the lines&#8221;... Therefore, you attribute to this imaginary censor faculties which you yourself do not possess, and to the text a significance which it actually does not have. For your alter ego pursues your thoughts ad absurdum, until the dizzy end where everything is subversive, where to tread is dangerous and condemnable. </em><br></p><p>&#8220;Lonely and unwitnessed,&#8221; &#8220;dangerous and condemnable&#8221;<em> </em>&#8212; Ki&#353;'s perfect and tragic adjectives &#8212; describe how many people feel today, when confronted with the internet's many opportunities for self-presentation, and equally many opportunities for self-destruction. Under the pitiless eye of mass surveillance, which funnels the most tentative keystroke into our permanent records, we begin to surveil ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike in&nbsp;Ki&#353;'s milieu, or in contemporary North Korea, or Saudi Arabia, the coercive apparatus doesn't have to be the secret police knocking at the door.&nbsp;For fear of losing a job, or of losing an admission to school, or of losing the right to live in the country of your birth, or merely of social ostracism, many of today's best minds in so-called free, democratic states have stopped trying to say what they think and feel and have fallen silent. That, or they adopt the party-line of whatever party they would like to be invited to &#8212; whatever party their livelihoods depend on. </p><p>Such is the trickle-down effect of the institutional exploitation of the internet, of corporate algorithms that thrive on controversy and division: the degradation of the soul as a source of profit &#8212; and power.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lifting the mask]]></title><description><![CDATA[Edward Snowden on privacy, on liberty, on Substack]]></description><link>https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/lifting-the-mask</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/lifting-the-mask</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Edward Snowden]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 19:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48b03234-8819-46be-babf-e188daed8e62_1394x1592.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-485-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb189b5b2-9d98-4715-9ced-2b7ea4c5a7df_1500x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb189b5b2-9d98-4715-9ced-2b7ea4c5a7df_1500x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b189b5b2-9d98-4715-9ced-2b7ea4c5a7df_1500x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:133090,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

I think everybody has had this kind of experience: the more conscious you are of being recorded, the more self-conscious you become. Merely the awareness that there is, or might be, somebody pressing record on their smartphone and pointing it at you can cause awkwardness, even if that somebody is a friend. [...] In a situation that was already high-intensity, I stiffened. The red light of Laura&#8217;s camera, like a sniper&#8217;s sight, kept reminding me that at any moment the door might be smashed in and I&#8217;d be dragged off forever. And whenever I wasn&#8217;t having that thought, I kept thinking about how this footage was going to look when it was played back in court. I realized there were so many things I should have done, like putting on nicer clothes and shaving. Room-service plates and trash had accumulated throughout the room. There were noodle containers and half-eaten burgers, piles of dirty laundry and damp towels on the floor. It was a surreal dynamic. Not only had I never met any filmmakers before being filmed by one, I had never met any journalists before serving as their source. The first time I ever spoke aloud to anyone about the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, I was speaking to everyone in the world with an Internet connection. In the end, though, regardless of how rumpled I looked and stilted I sounded, Laura&#8217;s filming was indispensable, because it showed the world exactly what happened in that hotel room in a way that newsprint never could.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>That was how I described how I felt in my memoir&nbsp;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;<em>Permanent Record. </em>Today, when I re-read that passage, and when I replay that old clip, I have a curious sense of distance: it's me, but also it's not. I still stand by the words, yet I can't help but acknowledge that I'm always standing at a different remove, contemplating the past from a new perspective, determined by all that has changed in the time that's elapsed. Between the clip and the memoir, my girlfriend Lindsay and I were reunited and married. Between the memoir and the present, we became parents to a son. Between that child and the writing of this sentence, I developed a new appreciation for time.</p><p>Though my relationship to time fluctuates, the gravamen of my disclosures remains constant.&nbsp;In the past eight years, the depredations of surveillance have merely become more entrenched, with the capabilities that used to be the province of governments now in the hands of private companies, too, which employ them to track and tether us and attenuate our freedoms. This enduring danger, this compounding danger, is one of the reasons I've decided to lift my voice again &#8212; adding a new page to my "permanent record"...one to which I hope you subscribe.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>2.</p><p><strong>Since 2013,</strong> it feels as though the world has accelerated, when really only the rate of opinion has &#8212; through the sheer speed and volume of&nbsp;bite-sized&nbsp;algorithmically "curated" social media. On Facebook, and especially on Twitter, plots and characters appear and vanish in moments,&nbsp;imparting emotions, but never lessons, because who has time for those? The only thing that most of us manage to take away from social media, besides the occasional chuckle, is an updated roster of villains &#8212; the daily roll-call of transgressors and transgressions.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the reality of the fully commercialized mainstream internet: our exposure to an indigestible mass of shortest-form opinions that are purposefully selected by algorithms to agitate us on&nbsp;platforms that are designed to record and memorialize our most agitated, reflexive responses. These responses are, in turn, elevated in proportion to their controversy to the attention &#8212; and prejudice &#8212; of the crowd. In the resulting zero-sum blood sport that public reputation requires, combatants are incentivized to occupy the most conventionally defensible positions, which reduces all politics to ideology and splinters the polis into squabbling tribes. The products of the irreconcilable differences this process produces are nothing more than well-divided "audiences," made available to the influence of advertisers, and all that it cost us was the very foundation of civil society: tolerance.</p><p>For this reason, I'd like to do my part in encouraging a return to longer forms of thinking and writing, which provide more room for nuance and more opportunity for establishing consensus or, at the very least, respecting a diversity of perspective and, you know, science.</p><p>I want to revive the original spirit of the older, pre-commercial internet, with its bulletin boards, newsgroups, and blogs &#8212; if not in form, then in function.</p><p>The utopianism of these blogs might seem as quaint today as the sites' graphics (and glamorous MIDI audio), but whatever those outlets lacked in sophisticated design, they more than made up for in curiosity and intelligence and in their fostering of originality and experimentation. They were, when it comes down to it, not curated and templated "platforms" so much as direct expressions of the creative primacy of the individual.</p><p>One history of the Internet &#8212; and I'd argue a rather significant one &#8212; is the history of the individual's disempowerment, as governments and businesses both sought to monitor and profit from what had fundamentally been a user-to-user or peer-to-peer relationship. The result was the centralization and consolidation of the Internet &#8212; the true y2k tragedy. This tragedy unfolded in stages, a gradual infringement of rights: users had to first be made transparent to their internet service providers, and then they were made transparent to the internet services they used, and finally they were made transparent to one another. The intimate linking of users' online personas with their offline legal identity was an iniquitous squandering of liberty and technology that has resulted in today's atmosphere of accountability for the citizen and impunity for the state. Gone were the days of self-reinvention, imagination, and flexibility, and a new era emerged &#8212; a new eternal era &#8212; where our pasts were held against us. Forever.</p><p><em>Everything we do now lasts forever...&nbsp;</em>The Internet's&nbsp;synonymizing of digital presence and physical existence ensures fidelity to memory, identitarian consistency, and ideological conformity. Be honest: if one of your opinions provokes the hordes&nbsp;on social media, you're less likely to ditch your account and start a new one than you are to apologize and grovel, or dig in and harden yourself ideologically. Neither of those "solutions" is one that fosters change, or intellectual and emotional growth.</p><p>The forced identicality of online and offline lives, and the permanency of the Internet's record, augur against forgiveness, and advise against all mercy. Technological omniscience, and the ease of accessibility, promulgate a climate of censorship that in the so-called free world instantiates as self-censorship: people are afraid to speak and so they speak the party's words... or people are afraid to speak and so they speak no words at all...</p><p>Even the most ardent practitioners of cancel culture &#8212; which I've always read as an imperative: Cancel culture! &#8212; must admit that cancellation is a form of surveillance borne of the same technological capacities used to oppress the vulnerable by patriarchal, racist, and downright unkind governments the world over. The intents and outcomes might be different &#8212; cancelled people are not sent to camps &#8212; but the modus is the same: a constant monitoring, and a rush to judgment.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3. </strong></p><p>If this past year-and-change has taught us anything, it's how interconnected we all are &#8212; a bat coughs and the world gets sick. Vaccines aside, our greatest weapon for defeating Covid-19 has been the mask, an accessory I'd formerly appreciated only a symbol: masks make secret, masks hide, masks cover, in protests as in pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>The social value of the mask has been made clear: they're not deceptive so much as protective, of ourselves and of others too. Masking is a mutual responsibility, a symbol of common identity founded in a common hope.&nbsp;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;This is the very same rhetoric I've always employed about the use of technological masks: about the use of Tor networks, virtual private networks, encryption keys, and allied technologies that protect our identities online. Over the past eight years, the number of people &#8212; of organizers, protestors, journalists, and regular people &#8212; who've adopted these masks has been heartening, but then so too has been the courage of those who speak unmasked, in situations where their speech demands the authentication of experience. As with so-called public health, so with the health of the body politic: to drop the mask requires confidence in one's fellow citizens, and in the system in general. From the blue checks to the red pills, we all want to be free to speak as ourselves, and to be recorded as ourselves, without fear of persecution, and we all want to be able to decide what that freedom means, to ourselves and to our communities, however defined. My family back home in the States, along with many of my friends in the States and in Europe, are lucky enough to now be going around unmasked, but millions &#8212; mostly in the world's poorer countries &#8212; have no such privilege. It's here that the analogy with speech freedoms comes into starkest relief: until the air is clear for all, it's clear for none.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the past eight years, I've spoken out in defense of speech freedoms on various platforms, but none has been a home. I've been edited by editors, moderated by moderators, crammed into newspaper and magazine columns next to the ads for fancy wristwatches; I've had my thoughts contorted by character-limitations and tripped-up by threads, <em>even before</em> they were taken out of context and misinterpreted, accidentally and willfully. Platforms should ensure a writer has full control over, and full ownership of, their intellectual property, so I'm glad to help give this one a fighting chance.  </p><p>Readers of this column should expect weekly posts dealing with civil liberties and technology, in addition to commentary on the worlds of whistleblowing and leaking, a series on false conspiracies (QAnon) v. true conspiracies (debt), news roundups, and various reviews and how-tos, for good measure. Subscribers will have access to audio versions of many of the pieces, as well as to a series of podcasts, featuring conversations between myself and friends and allies and occasionally, yes &#8212; in the spirit of this space &#8212; even some folks I disagree with.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/lifting-the-mask?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/lifting-the-mask?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
